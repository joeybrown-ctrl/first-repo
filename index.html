            <p>I am a non-tradional student and my life has also followed a non-traditional path. I was raised in a
                strict religious community that did not approve of education, so what I have learned in life has been
                mostly through trial and error. That's why I'm so passionate about the internet and
                tech in general, as they provide many paths towards greater knowledge. I have an ever-present hunger for
                learning and becoming a web developer feels like a great fit for that reason!</p>
